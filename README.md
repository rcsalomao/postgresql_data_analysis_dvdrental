# Data analysis of the Sakila DVD rental database

## Introduction

This is a data analysis project of the [Sakila DVD rental database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/) for the course [Programming for Data Science with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).
The main objective of this project is to propose and answer 4 questions related to the dataset.
A slide presentation should be the final result, composed by 4 slides, one for each question.
Each slide should contain the question, a visualization (graph, table, etc) and some commentary/insight.

## Project result presentation

The final resulting presentation can be found on the folder `project_submission/`, along with the 4 sql queries used to answer those questions.
In this project, Postgresql is used for the database and queries.
